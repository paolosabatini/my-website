<h4 style="margin-top:30px;margin-left:0px"> Covid-19 epidemic model </h4> <br><br>
<p align="left" style="color:gray"> 

  We all know about Covid-19 epidemy that hit the world (and still hits) in the period 2020-2022. Italy was one of the most affected countries, specifically northen-Italy regions cumulated most of the case in the first phase of the pandemia.<br><br>

  During the first months of the pandemia (March-April 2020), I was interested in modelling the behaviour of the virus spread, based on existing literature and tried to adapt it to the current ongoing pandemic. Data were barely accessible and models needed many assumptions to work properly, therefore I chose to restricted the analysis to the Lombardy case, as it was the most followed, with more data available and statistically the most significant. <br><br>

  On top of the current model, I made an extra step by adding a systematic uncertainties estimation and include them in a profile likelihood fit to data in order to measure the model parameters, in order to give prediction of the evolution of the epidemy (with the assumption that underlaying hypothesese held). <br><br>

          <p class="mb-0 text-white-50"> A brief analysis during the early - and dramatic - diffusion of COVID-19 in Lombardy. The analysis profited of a very limited amount of available data during March and April 2020 on COVID-19 and tempted a modellisation of the epidemic model. <br> Things got a bit rough afterwards, and I did not review it with more data.</p>
