<h4 > High-energy particle physics & Standard Model </h4> <br>
 <p align="left" style="color:gray"> High-energy physics studies the fundamental elements of matter, also called <em> fundamental particles </em>. It studies their interactions at the smallest scale of distances, therefore at the highest scales of energy. <br><br>

The theoretical model that describe such interactions is the <b> Standard Model </b> (SM), that has proven to be succesful in describing the particle interactions in the past 50 years and over several order of magnitudes of interaction strength. This makes the SM one of the most studied and robust theoretical framework ever.<br><br>

   In few words, the SM studies the evolution of fields (mathematical functions over space and time) that describe the probability of generating a particle in a given space-time point. The "laws of motion" of these fields are described by the use of a Lagrangian, that contains both free particle motion rules and interactions with other fields. Therefore, this theory let us to predict the probability of observing a given physical process, that can be measured experimentally. Also, it predicts un-observed and rare events that can be discovered in dedicated experiments. <br><br>

   The theory is extremely elegant (and surprisingly predictive). Interactions between particles are derived from symmetries of the theory over specific transformations (gauge) of the fields. Three interactions are described by the SM: <b>electromagnetic</b>, <b>weak</b> and <b>strong</b> interactions. Naively, they may be interpreted as exchange of a mediator particle, also called <b> force carrier </b>. Exchange of photons corresponds to electromagnetic interaction among electrically charged particles. Similarly, the heavy bosons W and Z are responsible of carrying the weak force, that is weak because of the large mass of the mediators. Eventually, the strong force is carried by gluons, so-called because it bounds the atomic nuclei together.

</p><br>
 <h4> Particles and their features </h5><br>
<p align="left" style="color:gray">
<b>The whole world we observe everyday is made of very few particles</b>. Essentially, everything we are used to deal with is made of three fundamental particles: electrons and up- and down- quarks. The quarks combine into proton and neutrons, that along with electron give bound states that are known as atoms, that are the bricks of our world.<br><br>

<b>Are there other particles then?</b> Oh yeah. Particles are classified based on their interactions, namely their quantum numbers. The first classification is based on their property under rotation, called spin, in fermion (half-integer spin) and boson (integer spin). All force carriers are bosons (*cof* Higgs boson *cof*), while all the other particles are fermions. <br><br>

<b>Leptons</b> are particles that interact via electromagnetic (only the charged ones) and weak forces. The charged leptons are electrons, muons and taus (ordered by mass). All them are coupled with the correspondi<b> neutrinos </b>, not charged and massless. In total 6 leptons are known so far, with the corresponding antiparticles. <br> <br>

<b>Quarks</b> have the same structure as the leptons in terms of electromagnetic and weak forces. The "up" and "down" type quarks are spearated by one unit charge (same as the leptons), but have fractionary electromagnetic charges, so all of them interact with photons. They are also arranged in three doublets with increasing mass. On top of this, they interact via strong force, and are featured by a strong-force charge, called <b>color</b>, that can assume three values (commonly red, green and blue). They interact with gluons, that cannot let coloured final state to be created, therefore <b>quarks and gluons cannot live freely</b>, but only in <b>bound state with no color</b>, such as <b>protons</b> and <b>neutrons</b>.

<br>

<h4> High-energy particle detectors </h5><br>
<p align="left" style="color:gray">

  In order to look at infinitesimally small structures, we need a very powerful microscope, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The same way we send light onto small surfaces and collect the scattered light with lens toward our eyes, the LHC send protons onto protons in order to study the structure of that, and the outcome of the collision is measured by the detector.<br><br>

  This is the case of the ATLAS Experiment, that is a general-purpose experiment, aiming at reconstructing with high precision and efficiency the products of the proton collision from LHC. To measure the a particle, we need to observe their interactions, as we cannot access at their scales with bare eyes to distinguish one from the other. This inspired the "onion-shape" that aims at measuring different features of the outcoming particles. <br><br>

  The innermost detector is usually the tracking system, called Inner Detector in ATLAS. It aims at reconstructing the trajectories of charged particles, as they release energy when crossing materials and let us measure their position and reconstruct the path. Charged particles also bend due to the presence of a magnetic field. The bending radius gives an measurement of the particle velocity (or momentum in HEP). The tracking system is covered by the calorimetric system, that aim at stopping any particle coming out to measure the energy, and are separated in electromagnetic (to measure electrons and photons) and hadronic (to measure hadrons, or bound state of quarks and gluons) sub-calorimeters. From particle energy and momentum, the mass can be reconstructed letting the particle to be identified. Only muons escape from the calorimetric system, and a tracking system for muons is placed outside. Neutrinos do not interact strongly, and they are usually reconstructed thanks to the unbalance of energy for each event (since energy of the collision must be conserved). <br><br>

 <b> Wow, extremely complex right?</b> What if I tell you that you cannot even access the detector during data-taking? Then, a huge system of performance monitoring must be in place to ensure a good data quality. One of them is the alignment of the detector, that is measured online during data-taking from the reconstructed trajectories of the outcoming tracks. Despite this may seem a secondary task, it is actually crucial: a poor knowledge of the geometry of the detecotr leads to  a poor quality of reconstructed trajectories and may give biases in physics quantities. For example, the alignment of the tracking system is one of the most important source of uncertainties in high-precision measurements that asks for high precision of the momentum measurments, such as the famous <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abk1781"> W-boson mass measurement from CDF collaboration</a>.

<h4> Top quark sector </h5><br>
<p align="left" style="color:gray">

  The top-quark is one of the six quarks in the Standard Model, and it is the heaviest fundamental particle known to date. From the high mass, many interesting features follow. Contrarily to all the other quarks, it decays before creating bound states (hadronisation), therefore its features can be directly asserted by studying the decay products. Therefore, precision measurements in the top quark sector are more precise and sort of easier with respect to any other strong interacting particle.<br><br>

  The large mass leads to a special role into the Standard Model and the symmetry breaking mechanism, as it strongly interacts with the Higgs boson. Therefore, the top quark is a great intstrument to inspect the Higgs properties as it is more abundant in LHC collisions. Properties of the top quark have been extensively studied from 1995, date of its discovery at TeVatron, and the Standard Model has shown to be accurate over <a href="https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/PUBNOTES/ATL-PHYS-PUB-2022-031/fig_01.png">five orders of magnitude of event probabilities</a>. <br><br>

The rarest process in this sector that have been "measured" (4.7 standard deviations from the background-only hypotesis) is the simultaneous production of four top quarks, that has been the topic of my PhD thesis.

<h4 style="margin:20px"> Dark Matter </h4><br>
<p align="left" style="color:gray">
  <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2020/09/aa33880-18/aa33880-18.html"> Cosmological measurements </a> indicate that the content of the Standard Model is only 5% of the total content of the Universe. A large fraction (~26%) is made be matter that does not interact with the known interactions to date, or at least extremely weakly, the so-called <b> Dark Matter (DM) </b>. <br><br>

In case DM is a Weakly-Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP), the LHC can be a DM factory, that may be measured with different signatures in the detector, therefore a long series of analyses have been conducted to search for any hint of this new matter. In case the DM produced in the collisions decays promptly to SM particles, it can be infered from the decay product as its mass can be easily reconstructed. Despite this is a clean signature of new physics, of course most of WIMPs do not decay promptly, so that these analysis may be non-sensitive. <br><br>

Below, two example of analyses searching for DM are shown. The analysis targeting the <b> monotop signature </b> assumes that the DM is stable and therefore escapes the detector, and measured as large missing energy, in this case produced in association with a top-quark. The analysis that exploits displaced jets in the detector, instead, assume the DM particle to be quasi-stable. A <b>jet</b> is a spray of particles that are produced by the hadronisation process of a strong-interacting particle, in general they are measured as a lot of tracks in the tracking system associated with a large energy deposit in the calorimeter. In case the long-lived DM particle decays in the calorimeter, no tracks are measured, but only a large deposit of energy is recorded.<br><br>

Unfortunately, both analyses have not led to new physics, but never say never!
