<h4 style="margin-top:30px;margin-left:0px">  Reinforcement learning </h4> <br><br>
<p align="left" style="color:gray"> 

  This was a first approach to reinforcement learning, together with my will of coding in <b>Java</b> for creating a basic game. The idea was to create the game and let it run by using automated inputs in order to make it running automatically and the possibility of being driven by a machine learning algorithm.<br><br>

  The status is that a <em> human-inspired </em> scheduling of action is created to be challanged by the coming algorithm. Track record of the games are saved and stored automatically, so that the training samples are generated, and games are possible to be launched automatically as well.
