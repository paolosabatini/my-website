<h4 > Women football </h4> <br>
<p align="left" style="color:gray">

  Women football is a <b>continously growing sport</b> as demonstrated by the increasing reach of <b>big events</b>, <b>higher paychecks</b> for the players and the <b>massive sponsorships</b> signed by clubs in the past few years. <b>Italy has moved late</b> in this direction with respect to the other countries, such as Germany, France, England and US, but it is reaching competitive levels in the last two years. Most of the merit is to be given by <b>Juventus FC Women</b>, diverting a lot of money on the female team from its (recent) creation until making it one of the best teams in Europe. The <b>year 2022</b> is a special year for the Italian female football: women footballers are recognised as professionals for the first year and the championship level has increased drastically and now way more competitive than the past.<br><br>

  <a href="https://www.lfootball.it"> <b> LFootball </b> </a> is the leading italian magazine on female football, and every year they organize the <b> fantasy football </b> game, that I am currently helping mantaining and developing. Meanwhile, a test of an automated evaluation of the player performances has been tried and documented below. It exploits open-access data from various sources and machine learning techniques for the mark estimation.
